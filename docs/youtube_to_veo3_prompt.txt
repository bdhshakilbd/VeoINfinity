## Key Rules for Frame Generation

### 1. First & Last Frame Per Clip
- Each video clip has exactly **2 frames**: `first` (start) and `last` (end)
- VEO3 will generate video interpolating between these keyframes

### 2. Frame Reuse Logic (IMPORTANT!)
**When the next clip starts from the same position as the previous clip ended:**

- Set `"generate_image": false` on the first frame of the new clip
- Add `"reuse_frame": "frame_XXX"` pointing to the last frame of the previous clip
- This saves image generation and ensures perfect continuity

**Example:**
- Clip 1 ends with frame_002 (character standing in doorway)
- Clip 2 starts with frame_003 (same character, same doorway, slight pose change)
- Result: `frame_003` should have `"generate_image": false, "reuse_frame": "frame_002"`

**When to reuse frames:**
- Same location and camera angle
- Same character positions
- Only subtle movement or expression changes
- Continuous action flow

**When NOT to reuse frames:**
- Location change
- Camera angle change (wide → close-up)
- Major character repositioning
- Scene cuts or transitions

### 3. Camera Angle Variations
When describing the same scene from different angles, use descriptive camera terms:

| Angle Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Wide/Establishing** | Shows full environment, characters small in frame |
| **Medium Shot** | Waist-up, good for dialogue and action |
| **Close-up** | Face/detail focus, emotional emphasis |
| **Over-the-shoulder** | From behind one character looking at another |
| **Low Angle** | Camera below eye level, makes subject imposing |
| **High Angle** | Camera above, makes subject vulnerable/small |
| **Dutch Angle** | Tilted camera for tension/disorientation |
| **POV** | First-person perspective of a character |
| **Tracking** | Camera follows moving subject |
| **Pan/Tilt** | Camera rotates on axis |

### 4. Size Index Reference
```
1: very small (toddler/pet ~2-3 feet)
2: small (child ~4 feet)
3: below average (~5 feet)
4: slightly below average (~5'6")
5: average (~5'10")
6: above average (~6'2")
7: tall (~6'5")
8: very tall (~7 feet)
9: giant (8+ feet)
10: massive (building-sized)
```

## Now Analyze This Video

**YouTube Video URL:** [Paste URL Here]

Generate the complete JSON following this schema. Be thorough in:

1. **Identifying all distinct characters** with detailed appearances
2. **Describing all locations** with rich environmental details
3. **Breaking down the video into logical clips** with clear first/last frame descriptions
4. **Using frame reuse strategically** - when clip N+1 starts exactly where clip N ended, mark `"generate_image": false` and reference the previous frame
5. **Including camera angles** that match the original video's cinematography
6. **Writing prompts** that would allow accurate image generation

**CRITICAL: Use "generate_image": false and "reuse_frame" whenever possible to save resources and ensure perfect continuity between clips!**

Output ONLY valid JSON - no markdown code blocks, no explanations, just the raw JSON object.
