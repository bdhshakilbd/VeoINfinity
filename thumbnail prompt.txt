made with nano banana pro:
A wide shot inside a modern banana processing factory. A long conveyor belt carries **enormous, oversized bananas towering over the workers**, some whole and some **cut open to reveal pale interiors**. Small workers of varying ethnicities in white lab coats and hairnets inspect and sort the massive bananas, emphasizing the extreme scale difference. Bright fluorescent lighting creates a clean, sterile atmosphere, with stainless steel machinery in the background. The vibrant yellow bananas dominate the scene, contrasting against the white and metallic factory environment.
