Your task is to deconstruct the video's narrative and visual elements into a structured JSON format that can be used for story and video generation. The JSON output should conform to the schema I will describe.

The goal is to create a detailed "story bible" and shot list from the video, capturing the essence of its visual style, characters, locations, and the sequence of events.

**JSON Structure and Instructions:**

1.  **`story`**:
    *   **`title`**: Provide a concise, descriptive title for the story of the video.
    *   **`visual_style`**:
        *   **`art_style`**: Describe the overall visual aesthetic (e.g., "cinematic fantasy," "gritty sci-fi," "documentary style").
        *   **`color_palette`**: Detail the dominant colors and tones (e.g., "vibrant neon colors," "muted earthy tones").
        *   **`lighting`**: Describe the lighting style (e.g., "high-contrast, dramatic lighting," "soft, natural light").
        *   **`aspect_ratio`**: Specify the video's aspect ratio (e.g., "16:9," "2.35:1").
        *   **`quality`**: Note any distinct visual qualities (e.g., "film grain," "sharp 4K").

2.  **`characters`**:
    *   Identify the main characters in the video.
    *   For each character, create an object with:
        *   **`id`**: A unique identifier (e.g., "char\_hero," "char\_mentor").
        *   **`name`**: The character's name, if known. If not, use a descriptive title (e.g., "The Traveler").
        *   **`description`**: A detailed description of their appearance, including clothing, age, and key features.

3.  **`locations`**:
    *   Identify the distinct locations or settings in the video.
    *   For each location, create an object with:
        *   **`id`**: A unique identifier (e.g., "loc\_forest," "loc\_city\_downtown").
        *   **`name`**: A descriptive name for the location.
        *   **`description`**: A rich description of the environment.

4.  **`frames`**:
    *   Break down the video into a series of key scenes or shots.
    *   Each key moment should be represented by a "first" and "last" frame within a `video_clip`.
    *   For each frame, create an object with:
        *   **`frame_id`**: A unique identifier (e.g., "frame\_001").
        *   **`video_clip_id`**: The ID of the video clip this frame belongs to.
        *   **`frame_position`**: "first" or "last".
        *   **`location_id`**: The ID of the location where this frame takes place.
        *   **`characters_in_scene`**: A list of character IDs present in the frame.
        *   **`prompt`**: A detailed description of the action, character expressions, and composition of this specific frame. This should be written as a prompt for an image generation model.
        *   **`camera`**: A description of the camera shot (e.g., "medium shot, eye level," "wide establishing shot").

5.  **`video_clips`**:
    *   Group the frames into logical video clips that represent continuous actions or scenes.
    *   For each clip, create an object with:
        *   **`clip_id`**: A unique identifier (e.g., "video\_001").
        *   **`first_frame`**: The `frame_id` that starts this clip.
        *   **`last_frame`**: The `frame_id` that ends this clip.
        *   **`duration_seconds`**: Estimate the duration of this clip in seconds.
        *   **`veo3_prompt`**: A concise prompt that describes the overall action and transition from the first frame to the last frame, suitable for a video generation model.
        *   **`audio_description`**: A brief description of the sound, music, and dialogue in this clip.

Now, based on this structure, analyze the provided YouTube video and generate the complete JSON output.  {
