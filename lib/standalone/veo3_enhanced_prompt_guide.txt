# YouTube Video to VEO3 Story Prompt Generator (ENHANCED DETAILED VERSION)

## Instructions for AI (Claude/Gemini/GPT)

Analyze the content of the YouTube video at the following link: **[Insert YouTube Video Link Here]**

Your task is to deconstruct the video into a structured JSON format optimized for VEO3 video generation with DETAILED prompts covering all cinematic elements.

## 🔴 STRICT FRAME REUSE RULE

**MANDATORY: Every clip's first frame MUST reuse the previous clip's last frame!**

The ONLY exception is the very first frame of the entire video (frame_001).

### Generation Pattern:
- **Clip 1:** Generate BOTH frames (first and last)
- **Clip 2+:** Generate ONLY last frame (first frame reuses previous clip's last)

**Result: For N clips, generate only N+1 images instead of 2N!**

## 🎬 VEO3 PROMPT EXAMPLES (Detailed Format)

### Example 1: Action Scene
```
veo3_prompt: "Cinematic action, high contrast lighting. Young warrior in leather armor sprints through torch-lit stone corridor, dodging falling debris. Runs left to right frame, jumping over obstacles, cape flowing behind. Face shows determination mixed with fear. CAMERA: Steadicam following shot, slight low angle, tracking at running speed. Movement becomes intensely handheld as explosion rocks the corridor behind her."

audio_description: {
  "sfx": ["Boots pounding on stone floor", "Distant explosions", "Stones crumbling and falling", "Cape fabric whooshing", "Heavy breathing"],
  "bgm": "Intense orchestral percussion building, brass staccato hits, strings tremolo creating urgency, tempo accelerating",
  "speech": "Woman gasping: 'Almost there... just a little further!' - breathless, determined tone",
  "ambient": "Echo chamber acoustics, fire crackling in background, wind from corridors"
}
```

### Example 2: Emotional Dialogue Scene
```
veo3_prompt: "Intimate drama, soft diffused lighting through window. Elderly father sits in worn armchair, wrinkled hands clasped. Adult daughter kneels beside him, reaching for his hand. Both have tears forming. Scene is still except for subtle breathing. Warm golden hour light creates rim lighting on their silhouettes. CAMERA: Static medium two-shot, eye level, holds position to let emotion breathe. Slight dolly in as hands touch."

audio_description: {
  "sfx": ["Clock ticking softly", "Chair leather creaking", "Fabric rustling as daughter moves", "Soft sobbing"],
  "bgm": "Solo piano, melancholic minor key, simple melody, very soft dynamic level, played with rubato and emotional pauses",
  "speech": "Father (trembling voice): 'I should have told you sooner...' / Daughter (whispered, tearful): 'It's okay, Dad. I'm here now.'",
  "ambient": "Quiet room tone, distant birds outside, soft wind against windows"
}
```

### Example 3: Epic Reveal Scene
```
veo3_prompt: "Epic fantasy, volumetric god rays through clouds. Massive dragon (50 meters wingspan) emerges from mountain peak, wings unfurling in slow motion. Scales shimmer iridescent purple-gold. Hero figure small in foreground looks up in awe. Snow and debris scatter from wingbeats. CAMERA: Starts on hero close-up, dramatic crane up and out to reveal full dragon scale, continues pulling back to show size comparison. Dutch angle adds drama."

audio_description: {
  "sfx": ["Massive wings unfurling like sails", "Deep resonant roar shaking the air", "Rocks crumbling from mountain", "Wind rush from wingbeats", "Snow and ice scattering"],
  "bgm": "Full orchestra fortissimo, brass fanfare, choir singing 'ahh' in awe, timpani rolls, crescendo to peak as dragon fully revealed",
  "speech": "Hero (awestruck whisper): 'By the gods...' - voice barely audible against the spectacle",
  "ambient": "Mountain wind howling, distant thunder, echo off mountain peaks"
}
```

### Example 4: Horror/Suspense Scene
```
veo3_prompt: "Psychological horror, chiaroscuro lighting with deep shadows. Woman alone in Victorian bedroom, candle only light source. Shadows move unnaturally on walls behind her - she doesn't notice. Slowly turns head, sensing something. Eyes widen in terror as she sees reflection in mirror that doesn't match her movement. CAMERA: Static wide shot holding unnervingly long, then slow zoom into mirror reflection. Handheld shake increases with tension."

audio_description: {
  "sfx": ["Floorboards creaking with no footsteps", "Candle flame flickering", "Something scratching behind walls", "Sharp intake of breath", "Mirror glass vibrating subtly"],
  "bgm": "Atonal strings, dissonant cello drones, sudden silence for maximum impact, single piano note struck when horror revealed",
  "speech": "Woman (terrified whisper): 'Who... who's there?' - voice cracking, barely controlled panic",
  "ambient": "Oppressive silence, distant house settling, wind moaning through gaps in windows"
}
```

### Example 5: Comedy Scene
```
veo3_prompt: "Bright comedy, flat even lighting like sitcom. Clumsy chef in white uniform navigates busy restaurant kitchen. Slips on banana peel in slow motion, arms windmilling, expression transforming from confidence to panic to resignation. Knocks over stack of pots in domino effect. Falls into giant wedding cake. CAMERA: Wide shot to capture chaos, whip pan following flying pots, crash zoom on face before impact with cake."

audio_description: {
  "sfx": ["Cartoon slip sound", "Cascading metal pots clanging", "Splat into frosting", "Comedic whistle during fall", "Kitchen staff gasping then laughing"],
  "bgm": "Upbeat jazz percussion, pizzicato strings during slip, trombone 'wah-wah' for impact, returns to cheerful melody",

Elderoot now standing tall, bark green and new, eyes bright. He lifts a laughing Lily onto his shoulder. Flowers bloom around them in time-lapse speed. Animals emerge from restored foliage. Bioluminescent particles dance in sunbeams. Crystal lantern on Lily's belt now blazes pure white. Both look toward rising sun, silhouetted against warm light.

## 🔧 AUDIO PROMPT FORMATTING TIPS

### Good SFX Examples:
❌ "Sound effects"
❌ "Walking sounds"
✅ "Heavy boots crunching on gravel, then splashing through puddle"
✅ "Keys jingling in pocket, followed by metallic door lock clicking open"

### Good BGM Examples:
❌ "Dramatic music"
❌ "Orchestral soundtrack"
✅ "Low cello sustain building tension, sudden silence, then full brass and percussion impact"
✅ "Playful xylophone melody over pizzicato strings, tempo quickening with character's excitement"

### Good Speech Examples:
❌ "Character speaks"
❌ "Dialogue happens"
✅ "Man (gruff, Brooklyn accent): 'You think this is a game?' - spoken through clenched teeth"
✅ "Child (excited, slightly out of breath): 'Mom, mom, look what I found!' - volume increasing with excitement"

## 📌 GENERATION RULES

1. **ONLY frame_001 gets `"generate_image": true` as a first frame**
2. **ALL other first frames get `"generate_image": false, "reuse_frame": "frame_XXX"`**
3. **ALL last frames get `"generate_image": true`**
4. **Each last frame must show meaningful visual CHANGE from its first frame**
5. **veo3_prompt must describe the ACTION/TRANSITION between first and last frame**
6. **audio_description must sync with visual action timing**
